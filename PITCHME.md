@title[what]

How many times you were in this situation?

@css[text-blue fragment](Your Partner:) @css[fragment](Can you throw the trash?)

---

You wanted to say yes, but you were in the middle of something important

@img[fragment](./fifa.jpeg)

---

So you said: @css[fragment](Sure, I'll do that later)

Note:

- This has many possible outcomes, but most of them are not good for you

---

You might just forget

---

Or even worse...

@css[fragment](Your partner do it for you)

Note:

- You know this is even worse that the previous case... Your partner had to do something that you said you would do
- so, consequences of this?

---

Your partner got disappointed and possibly stressed.

@css[fragment](So you got stressed)

---

Your partner had to do extra work which might have screwed up her entire schedule.

@css[fragment](DIRTY TOILET PLACEHOLDER)

Note:

- Imagine she was going to clean the toilet and could not do that because of the trash situation.
- I actually searched for "dirty toilet", but the images I got were too strong... use your imagination

Note:

- Maybe there were other consequences, like the trash now is piling up in the street because you did not take it out on times
- You could've been communicated about this if you were said that you will take a week to take the trash out
- By this point you should be traumatized but you should also realise that this happens also at work.
- when you say "Sure, I'll do that" you leave a lot of room for things to go wrong


---

Think your answer thoroughly.

@ul
- Are you really willing to do it?
- Are you able to do it?
- Does it depend on you?
- Do you have the time?
- When will you have the time?
@ulend


Note:

- So, first thing. If you are not going to do it, don't say you will.
- Think your answer thoroughly.
- Go with the list


---

Communicate **by** when you are going to do it.


Note:

- Again, be thorough about this, don't say things because
- This also sets the expectations and gives the other person the opportunity of analizing other options.
In the example of the trash your partner could decide to take the trash out by themselves for example.

---


F***ing do it.

@css[fragment](or raise a red flag)


Note:

- and of course, you said you'd do it so do it.
- and if for some reason you can't raise a red flag.

---

Commitment language


@css[fragment](I will do ... by ...)

Note:

- There's this thing called Commitment language
- It consist on saying things in this form
