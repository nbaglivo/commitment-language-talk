So you said:
@css[text-blue fragment](Your Partner:) @css[fragment](Sure, I'll do that later)

Note:

- This has many possible outcomes, but most of them are not good for you

You might just forget

Note:

- You know this is even worse that the previous case... Your partner had to do something that you said you would do

Or you do it, but too late
